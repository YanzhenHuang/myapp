## Get Started

- **Server (Backend)** 
    The backend is provided by [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/), which is a light-weight
    backend that provides a simple API to manage records stored using MySQLite. 
    Run pocketbase server by typing `./pocketbase serve` in the terminal.

- **Development (Frontend)** run `npm run dev`
    This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.
